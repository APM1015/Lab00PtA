  My tuls.c project consisted of three functions and a main method. My main method simply checks the number of arguments.
If there are greater than two or less than zero arguments then and error occurs and the program fails. If there are none
ore one argument then the program calls my tuls function which prints out all the files. If there are two arguments
then the main method calls my recursive function which also uses the checkDir function.
  While making this I found the recursive part rather difficult. My original recursive function was working for 
 printing out all the file names, but not the content connected to the directory. So I kept that in the tuls functio
 because it was doing the job for the call with no arguments. I decided to take that code, and modify it for the 
 recursive function.
  When debuging the assignment, I found that my tuls function was not working recursively because it was skipping
 over my if statement in the while loop. So I decided to use stat to check if a file was a directory. This seemed
 to work when testing it, but I was running into a problem. I was unable to eliminate the "." and ".."s. So the 
 function would creat an infinite directory of "./../../". Unfourtunately, I was not able to fix this problem 
 before the lab was due. So I submited what I had, and will explain further in my demo.
